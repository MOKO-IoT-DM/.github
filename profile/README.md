# MOKO IoT DM

Once you have received the test sample and obtained a test account through the salesperson, you can login to MOKOCloud to test your device.

MOKO IoT DM can help you quickly access the server, view the Bluetooth device data scanned by the gateway through the server, configure gateway filtering conditions, set gateway function parameters, test downlink connection Bluetooth devices and upgrade.

Please refer to the [User Guide][1] for how to use it.
